  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Motivated and creative, I pride myself as being an exceptionally fast learner and flexible jackof-all-trades. With approaching fifteen years of programming, I specialize in robotics, games,
and neural AI but also have deep interests in new technologies and physics. I’m constantly
looking for new challenges and opportunities to broaden my skill-sets.
My dream is to be able to interact with a simulated universe, populated with beings that have
their own goals and aspirations, unrestricted by the laws of our physics.</p>
